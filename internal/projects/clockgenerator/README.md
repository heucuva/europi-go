# Clock Generator

A simple gate/clock generator based on YouTube video observations made about the operation of the ALM Pamela's NEW Workout module.

## Scope of This App

The scope of this app is to drive the CV 1 output as a gate output.

### Outputs

- CV 1 = Gate output

## Using Clock Generator

### Performance Clock

While Clock Generator is operating, you can turn Knob 1 to change the BPM. This range is between 0.01 and 240.0.

### TODO

More functionality and menu-diving to come...
