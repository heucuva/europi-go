# Complex Envelope

A random gate generator based on YouTube video observations made about the operation of the After Later Audio/mxmxmx uO_C (micro Ornament & Crime) module.

## Scope of This App

The scope of this app is to drive the CV 1 and CV 2 outputs as enveloped values using complex configurations.

### Inputs

- Digital Input = gate input (optional / recommended, see below)
- Analogue Input = CV for Attack parameter attenuation (applied to both envelopes)

### Outputs

- CV 1 = Envelope 1 output
- CV 2 = Envelope 2 output

## Using Complex Envelope

### Triggering / Gating

While Complex Envelope is operating, you can manually trigger an envelope by pressing, holding for a desired period, then releasing Button 1 for Envelope 1 or Button 2 for Envelope 2.

### Attack Parameters

Turning the Knob 1 (for Envelope 1) or Knob 2 (for Envelope 2) potentiometers will change the base Attack duration parameter.

### TODO

More functionality and menu-diving to come...
