# Complex Random

A complex random number generator based on YouTube video observations made about the operation of the WMD/SSF Ultra-Random Analog module.

## Scope of This App

The scope of this app is to drive the CV 1 and CV 2 outputs as randomly-generated number.

### Inputs

- Digital Input = trigger a sampling of the value on the Analogue Input (optional)
- Analogue Input = value to sample (optional)

### Outputs

- CV 1 = randomly-generated value A
- CV 2 = randomly-genreated value B with slew

## Using Complex Random

### TODO

More functionality and menu-diving to come...
