# Random Gates

A random gate generator based on YouTube video observations made about the operation of the Ladik R-110 module.

## Scope of This App

The scope of this app is to drive the CV 1 output as a gate output with a random gate output based on a percentage chance of 33%.

### Inputs

- Digital Input = clock input (optional, see below)

### Outputs

- CV 1 = Random Gate output

## Using Random Gates

### Performance Clock

While Random Gates is operating, you can toggle between using the external clock (default mode at startup) and the internal 120 BPM clock by pressing Button 1 on the EuroPi. When the mode is active, you will be informed by seeing a small bar ( `_` ) in the upper-left corner of the display.

### TODO

More functionality and menu-diving to come...
